<h2>Wayside Youth and Family, Clinical Coordinator-Director:

</h2>

    <p>In my role as a Clinical Coordinator, and then Clinical Director of the Prescott Program in Boston, MA, I worked directly with teens and young adults with severe mental health challenges referred through the Department of Mental Health in a non-profit, community-based setting. We offered supportive housing, one-on-one, group and family therapy, as well as skills-based and creative “fun” groups and activities. I also facilitated teen and YA led groups designed to build connection and community for the youth and built relationships with local employers, universities and other youth programs to facilitate work, learning, and treatment options for young adults in the program.

<h2>Project Rebound, Mental Health Clinician</h2>

    <p>In my position with Volunteers of America and Project Rebound in Boston, MA, I offered both one-on-one and family counseling to children, teens and young adults in a non-profit office setting. I also worked 2 days a week at Project Rebound, a non-profit organization affiliated with Volunteers of America that offered housing, counseling and therapeutic programs for teenage boys who had been referred through the court systems for substance abuse issues. I offered one on one counseling, ran therapeutic and skills-based support groups for the youth, and offered family counseling and care coordination for their families.

<h2>Professional Nanny</h2>

<p>While attending graduate school, I worked part-time for 3 years as a professional nanny for a family with 3 children in Boston, MA. My primary role was to provide childcare and entertainment to a family’s toddler age daughter, then pick up their elementary aged children and provide after school care. During this time, I planned many fun activities, including things such as weekly library visits to story hour, daily walks to the park, and regular visits to the Science Museum. </p>
