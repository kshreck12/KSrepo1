<h2>Trader Joes, Mate
</h2>

    <p>In my current position as a mate at Trader Joe’s, I am in an assistant manager role in a retail setting where I supervise approximately 75 “crew” members, or staff, and where I directly mentor a group of 8-10 crew, offering support in identifying and working toward both professional and personal development goals. I also have gained experience in setting fiscal goals and managing the budget, hiring and training new employees, managing interpersonal/HR-related challenges amongst the crew and creating and managing a weekly schedule for the entire store. I have also worked to build both crew engagement through leadership of a fun committee, where we offered activities such as the “Trader Joe Olympics” and food tastings where crew can try new products in a relaxed atmosphere. I also have built community engagement through overseeing our food donation program, where we offer food baskets to local non-profit organizations.

<h2>Wayside Youth and Family, Clinical Director role, 2015-2016</h2>

    <p>In my role as Clinical Director of the Prescott Program, I was responsible for all intakes of new youth and their families to the program,  care coordinating with the Department of Mental health, hiring, mentorship, and staff development of a 6 person team of social workers, as well as developing and facilitating new supportive programming, such as a support/skills-based group for the youths’ parents I founded to support their ability to better manage their own challenges and needs. I also served on a monthly leadership risk committee with the department of mental health and the larger Wayside Youth and Family organization to discuss and address issues related to the most at-risk youth and family cases in the program.
