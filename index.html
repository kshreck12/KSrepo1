     <h2> About Kate </h2>

    <p>I hope to use my combined experience and passion of working with children and families as a former counselor/social worker, as well as holding professional management roles in various settings, to be a librarian and a leader in a children’s and teen library environment. I am a lifelong reader and lover of public libraries who is also a little bit crazy about used book stores! I have a BA in English Literature from Fordham University in 2007, and an MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Lesley University in 2013. Currently, I am working towards my MA in Library and Information Sciences at Drexel University. I love librarianship as a second career because it combines my love of working with kids with my interest and skills in developing and running programs as well as mentoring/developing others into leadership roles. I also want to be a part of helping libraries stay relevant by developing strong technical skills, building on my strong research skills and incorporating my social justice focus into aspects of librarianship like building diverse book collections and developing (and seeing through) more inclusive hiring practices. I have lived in Boston, New York and Philadelphia (hard to say a favorite, though Philly is currently my home and where my family comes from, so I really love it). I am also super into hiking and camping, rescuing older (less popular) dogs and making my own sourdough bread. While I love reading all types of books, there here is something about used books and bookstores that is like coming home to me (weirdly, I am known for smelling old books when I get them, but I know I’m not alone in loving the sensory experience of a book).
