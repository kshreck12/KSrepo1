            <p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly…who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly. ~Teddy Roosevelt</p>

            <h2>Professional Goal</h2>

            <p>I hope to use my combined experience and passion of working with children and families as a former counselor/social worker, as well as holding professional management roles in various settings, to be a librarian and a leader in a children’s and teen library environment. I have a BA in English Literature from Fordham University in 2007, and an MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Lesley University in 2013. Currently, I am working towards my MA in Library and Information Sciences at Drexel University. I love librarianship as a second career because it combines my love of working with kids with my interest and skills in developing and running programs as well as mentoring/developing others into leadership roles. I also want to be a part of helping libraries stay relevant by developing strong technical skills, building on my strong research skills and incorporating my social justice focus into aspects of librarianship like building diverse book collections and developing (and seeing through) more inclusive hiring practices.</p>
