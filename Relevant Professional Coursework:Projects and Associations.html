    <h1>Relevant Professional Coursework/Projects and Associations
</h1>

<h2>Coursework/Projects</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Foundations of Data and Information-A foundational course emphasizing understanding metadata, including learning how to create metadata records.</li>
    <li>Users, Services and Resources-A course focused on user experience, reference librarianship and related technical skills, in which I created a <a href="https://drexellis.libguides.com/c.php?g=1321281&p=9720589" target="_blank">Libguide Project</a></li> aimed at offering fiction and non-fiction feminist and diversity-focused resources to teenage girls.</li>
    <li>Ethics for Information Professionals-A course focused on professional ethics in the librarian and UX fields. For this course, I wrote a research paper exploring the current significant problem of conservative groups targeting librarians and attempting to ban books, as well as the lesser known impact which involves librarians self-censoring their own collections in an attempt to avoid controversy (link).</li>
    <li>Leadership and Management of Libraries-A course I am currently enrolled in offering both the theoretical knowledge of management principles and practical skills such as developing a budget for an information organization.</li>
    <li>Introduction to Web Design for Information Organizations-A course I am currently enrolled in emphasizing developing technical skills related to web design (HTML coding, CSS), which will bolster my goal of being competent to create and improve library websites as well as library research guides.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Professional Associations</h2>

<p>I am interested in joining and attending conferences for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>ALA-American Library Association, a national, large library organization offering support and development for librarians, and one that I especially appreciate because it actively opposes book bans and offers confidential reporting for librarians that find themselves the target of current bans, which is a growing problem in the library community.</li>
    <li>ALSC-Association for Library Service to Children which, in addition to offering continuing education resources and conferences, also offers specific helpful information for children and teen librarians such as book reading lists, virtual services storytime guides, etc.</li>
    <li>PLA-Public Library Association-A division of the ALA focused specifically on issues and continuing education relevant to public libraries, and emphasizing things like the fight against “fake news” and incorporating social justice principles into public library systems.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Advocacy Organizations/Links</h2>

<p>The following includes a list of organizations that I follow that are doing important work around social justice as it relates to libraries, as well as offering additional resources to librarians facing book bans, a topic about which I have become very invested.
