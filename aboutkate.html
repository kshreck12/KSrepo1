    <p> I am a lifelong reader and lover of public libraries who is also a little bit crazy about used book stores!  I have lived in Boston, New York and Philadelphia (hard to say a favorite, though Philly is currently my home and where my family comes from, so I really love it). I come from a big, close-knit family and have 3 younger brothers and a growing number of nieces and nephews, not to mention dogs. When I'm not reading, working, or doing schoolwork, I love hanging out at the shore (one of my favorite places). I am also super into hiking and camping, rescuing older (less popular) dogs and making my own sourdough bread. While I love reading all types of books, there here is something about used books and bookstores that is like coming home to me (weirdly, I am known for smelling old books when I get them, but I know I’m not alone in loving the sensory experience of a book).</p>
